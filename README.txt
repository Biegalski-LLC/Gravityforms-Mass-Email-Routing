Email routing in gravity forms is great, unless you have hundreds of different routes all based on the value of a specific field. This plugin will hopefully solve this issue by emailing routing based on a database table.

== Description ==

Email routing in gravity forms is great, unless you have hundreds of different routes all based on the value of a specific field. This plugin will hopefully solve this issue by emailing routing based on a database table.

When importing the data into the table, all columns are required for proper routing. For each entry, you will need to define the form ID number, field ID number, field value, email address and which notification to send.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload the `gravityforms-email-routing` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Import email routes with a database management tool such as phpMyAdmin or MySQL Workbench.
